 *  \brief Ring describes a ring type geometry for tracking
 *
 *  Ring describes a ring type geometry for tracking. Ring provides the
 *  necessary interfaces for e.g. OPAL-CYCL to track through the ring geometry,
 *  while enabling the user to add arbitrary field elements in a closed
 *  geometry.
 *
 *  Ring uses similar routines to OPAL-T OpalBeamline class to set up
 *  geometry; note that as OPAL-CYCL places the beam in an x-y geometry we place
 *  in an x-y geometry for Ring (i.e. the axis of the ring is by default the
 *  z-axis). So far only placement of elements in the midplane is supported. It
 *  is not possible to give vertical displacements or rotations, or add elements
 *  that might create vertical displacements and rotations.
 *
 *  Also aim to maintain backwards compatibility with Cyclotron (i.e. use
 *  ParallelCyclotronTracker)
