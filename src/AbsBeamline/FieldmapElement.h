/**
 * @class FieldmapElement
 * @brief A straight element whose field comes entirely from a static field map: magnetic,
 *        electric, or both.
 *
 * Unlike SBEND, RBEND or QUADRUPOLE, this element has no analytic field of its own and
 * derives nothing from the input file: the map supplies the field, and the map's own extent
 * supplies the element's box. Nothing about the element's orientation is computed from a
 * bend angle, which is what makes it usable for a measured magnet whose real deflection is
 * whatever the tabulated field produces.
 *
 * @note The element's local frame IS the map's coordinate frame. The map is queried at the
 *       particle position without any shift, so the 6D lab pose (X, Y, Z, THETA, PHI, PSI)
 *       positions the map's own origin.
 *       This is forced by Fieldmap::applyField(), which reads the particle positions
 *       directly and takes no offset.
 *
 * @note Because of that, a map whose z range does not start at zero has its body offset
 *       from the local origin. initialise() stores that offset with Geometry::setStartZ(), so
 *       the geometry's edges and ElementBase's aperture check cover the map's z range.
 *
 * @note Placement is restricted to the 6D lab pose. ELEMEDGE positions an element by path
 *       length along the reference orbit, which needs the element's length along that orbit;
 *       this element's extent comes from its map and is not a path length. The rejection
 *       lives in OpalFieldmapElement::update().
