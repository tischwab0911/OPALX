/** @Class Offset
 *
 *  Enables user to define a placement, either in global coordinates or in the
 *  coordinate system of the previously placed object
 *
 *  @param _end_position final position of the offset
 *  @param _end_direction normal vector to entry face
 *  @param _is_local parameter is True if everything is in the coordinate system
 *  of the last placed object. It is expected that everything will be in a local
 *  coordinate system before tracking begins (this is expected by, for example,
 *  Ring). This is expected to be set by the visit function in e.g.
 *  ParallelCyclotronTracker.
 *  @param geometry the geometry that RingSection uses to do displacements
 *  This has to be a pointer because SRotatedGeometry
 *  does not have an defined assignment op. SRotatedGeometry does not have
 *  a assignment op because BGeometryBase does not have an assignment op...
 *  and there is no way (I think) to reassign a previously assigned variable
 *  in C++ without using =
 *  @param wrappedGeometry Something to do with the reference handling in
 *  SRotatedGeometry - looks like it doesn't make a copy but holds a reference,
 *  so unless I keep that alive in Offset I get memory errors (seg fault)
 *  @float_tolerance bends() and operator==(...) use float_tolerance when
 *  evaluating equality between doubles.
 *  @lengthUnits_m conversion factor from user interface to get to mm
 *
 *  WARNING: this object uses a default aperture that is large. It will screw up
 *  any calculation based on aperture (e.g. wakefields etc)
