/**
 * @brief Host-side external-field integration shared by reference and transfer-map rays.
 *
 * Positions are in metres, time and step size in seconds, and mechanical momentum is
 * \f$\mathbf u=\mathbf p/(mc)=\vec\beta\gamma\f$. Fields are in V/m and tesla;
 * PartData supplies rest energy in eV and charge in elementary-charge units.
 * The default is drift--Boris-kick--drift. Map computation can instead select
 * classical RK4 or the twelve-stage eighth-order DOP853 formula. No collective
 * fields or analytic element transfer matrices enter this calculation.
 *
 * Boris drifts are evaluated directly in metres:
 * \f$\mathbf r_{1/2}=\mathbf r_0+(ch/2)\mathbf u_0/\gamma_0\f$ and
 * \f$\mathbf r_1=\mathbf r_{1/2}+(ch/2)\mathbf u_1/\gamma_1\f$,
 * where \f$\gamma_i=\sqrt{1+|\mathbf u_i|^2}\f$. The signed path is advanced by
 * \f[
 * \Delta s=\frac{ch}{2}\left(\frac{|\mathbf u_0|}{\gamma_0}
 *                         +\frac{|\mathbf u_1|}{\gamma_1}\right).
 * \f]
 * This integrates speed, not the chord between endpoints. It is exact for constant
 * speed (up to momentum/roundoff error), and second-order quadrature with electric
 * acceleration. Position, time and path additions retain Kahan correction terms.
 * The Boris kick, its order and field-support tolerances are unchanged. Only this
 * host-side reference/map tracker is affected, not the production particle pusher.
 *
 * RK4 and DOP853 solve the same relativistic Lorentz equations, including path:
 * \f[
 * \dot{\mathbf r}=c\mathbf u/\gamma,\qquad
 * \dot{\mathbf u}=\frac{qc}{\mathcal E_0}
 *    \left(\mathbf E+\frac{c}{\gamma}\mathbf u\times\mathbf B\right),\qquad
 * \dot s=c|\mathbf u|/\gamma,
 * \f]
 * where \f$\mathcal E_0=mc^2\f$ is the numerical rest energy in eV and q is the
 * signed charge in elementary-charge units. Each stage samples its own position,
 * momentum and time. For \f$\mathbf y=(\mathbf r,\mathbf u,s)\f$,
 * \f[
 * k_i=h f(t_0+c_i h,\mathbf y_0+\sum_{j<i}a_{ij}k_j),\qquad
 * \mathbf y_1=\mathbf y_0+\sum_i b_i k_i.
 * \f]
 * Time is advanced exactly by h with compensation. Weighted increments and
 * position/path updates use compensation, but momentum and field evaluations
 * remain doubles. DOP853 coefficients are documented in RungeKuttaTableau.h.
 * Both RK methods use fixed nominal DT, NOT adaptive error control. DOP853's
 * embedded 5/3 estimators and dense output are not used. An independent h/2 solve
 * supplies a same-order diagnostic midpoint; it does not change the full-h result.
 * Including its field sample, a smooth trial costs 9 evaluations for RK4 and 25
 * for DOP853 (versus 1 for Boris). These methods are not symplectic and do not
 * preserve magnetic energy exactly; their smooth global orders are 4 and 8.
 *
 * advance() resolves field-support transitions independently for each ray. A trial
 * is accepted only when support sets at the start, every field-evaluation stage,
 * diagnostic midpoint and end agree. Otherwise it is bisected, advancing the first
 * half before recomputing the second. Transition-containing substeps terminate at
 * \f[
 * c|h|\leq\max(10^{-12}c|\Delta t|,
 *     64\epsilon_{\rm mach}\max(1\,{\rm m},|\mathbf r|)).
 * \f]
 * Thus a residual straddle is bounded by the event tolerance or floating-point
 * spatial resolution, not by the nominal time step. Smooth-field steps retain
 * the selected discretization order. This is not a symplecticity guarantee:
 * the subdivision depends on the ray and the fields may be interpolated.
 *
 * The trial step is also capped at one quarter of the shortest positive longitudinal
 * field-support extent divided by c, preventing a regular longitudinal crossing
 * from skipping a complete thin element. The element's isInside() query, including
 * its bend chart, is authoritative. Grazing crossings, unresolved transverse holes
 * or discontinuities hidden inside a field table still require adequate nominal
 * resolution; support queries are not a field-interpolation error estimator.
