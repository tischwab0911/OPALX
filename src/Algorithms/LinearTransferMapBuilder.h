/**
 * @brief Construct external-field linear maps from a sampled reference orbit.
 *
 * Owns Bishop-frame transport, boundary refinement, the perturbed rays,
 * the pivoted finite-difference solve and ordered composition. The caller owns
 * the reference pass and attaches the returned maps to their runtime elements.
 * The builder neither modifies the beamline nor writes diagnostics to stdout.
 *
 * Two independent selections are used: nominal body containment splits the sampled
 * orbit into constant-owner segments, while each private ray selects field supports
 * at its own integration stages. Owners are attachment destinations, not an isolated
 * field model. Empty-owner intervals are retained in the full ordered product.
 * BeamlineMembership is logical sequence metadata and does not participate in either
 * selection. The supplied beamline and particle data must outlive this builder.
 * See LinearTransferMap for coordinates, units and the finite-difference equations.

     * @brief Explicit numerical configuration, independent of global OPTION state.

     * Level zero uses twelve centered-difference rays per segment. With L Richardson
     * levels, use \f$12(L+1)\f$ rays at amplitudes \f$\epsilon_j/2^k\f$,
     * \f$k=0,\ldots,L\f$. The tableau is
     * \f[
     * \begin{aligned}
     * R_{k,0}&=M(\boldsymbol\epsilon/2^k),\\
     * R_{k,j}&=R_{k,j-1}\\
     * &\quad+\frac{R_{k,j-1}-R_{k-1,j-1}}{4^j-1}.
     * \end{aligned}
     * \f]
     * Here \f$1\le j\le k\le L\f$ in the extrapolation recurrence.
     * Return \f$R_{L,L}\f$, formally \f$O(\epsilon^{2(L+1)})\f$ for a sufficiently smooth ray map.
     * This extrapolates perturbation size, not DT: integration, field interpolation,
     * boundary and roundoff errors remain. Levels are limited to four to bound the
     * ray cost (60 per segment) and discourage unsupported high-order precision claims.
     * The caller must use integrationMethod for the supplied reference orbit as well.
