/** SquarePolynomialVector, an arbitrary order polynomial vector class.
 *  \brief SquarePolynomialVector describes a vector of multivariate polynomials
 *
 *  Consider the vector of multivariate polynomials
 *  \f$y_i = a_0 + Sum (a_j x^j)\f$
 *  i.e. maps a vector \f$\vec{x}\f$ onto a vector \f$\vec{y}\f$ with\n
 *  \f$\vec{y} = a_0 + sum( a_{j_1j_2...j_n} x_1^{j_1} x_2^{j_2} ... x_n^{j_n})\f$.
 *  Also algorithms to map a single index J into \f$j_1...j_n\f$.\n
 *  \n
 *  PolynomialVector represents the polynomial coefficients as a matrix of
 *  doubles so that\n
 *  \f$ \vec{y} = \mathbf{A} \vec{w} \f$\n
 *  where \f$\vec{w}\f$ is a vector with elements given by \n
 *  \f$ w_i = x_1^{i_1} x_2^{i_2} ... x_n^{i_n} \f$ \n
 *  So the index \f$ i \f$ is actually itself a vector. The vectorisation of 
 *  \f$ i \f$ is handled by IndexByPower and IndexByVector methods.
 *  IndexByPower gives an index like:\n
 *  \f$ w_i = x_1^{i_1} x_2^{i_2} ... x_n^{i_n} \f$ \n
 *  While IndexByVector gives an index like:\n
 *  \f$ w_i = x_{i_1}x_{i_2} \ldots x_{i_n} \f$ \n
 *  \n
 *
 *  Nb: it is a *Square*PolynomialVector because coefficients include all
 *  polynomial coefficients with \f$ i_ j <= n \f$; coefficients sit within an
 *  n-dimensional square. The distinction should be made with a PolynomialVector
 *  where coefficients include all polynomial coefficients with 
 *  \f$ \Sigma(i_j) <= n. \f$
 * 
 *  Nb2: It is quite tricky to get right - mostly an excercise in indexing, but
 *  that is very easy to get wrong.
