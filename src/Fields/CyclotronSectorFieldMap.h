/**
 * @brief Shared PSI Ring median-plane magnetic map and first derivatives in SI units.
 *
 * The reader ports the layout of OPAL 2022.1 Cyclotron::getFieldFromFile_Ring:
 * radii in the file are millimetres, angles degrees, and magnetic values kilogauss.
 * Negative grid spacings denote the reciprocal of their absolute value.
 * File-supplied derivative blocks are consumed but recomputed from the base map
 * using OPAL's five-point Lagrange stencils (one-sided near either boundary).
 *
 * Both views have dimensions (nr, nt+1, 3). Channels 0, 1, 2 contain the stored
 * median-plane field F [T], dF/dr [T/m], and dF/dtheta [T/rad]. Column nt
 * copies column zero, including derivatives, to close the periodic angular seam.
 * The sign/coordinate conversion to the tracking frame belongs to CyclotronSector.
 *
 * @note Instances are shared by canonical filename and treated as read-only after
 * construction. The public Kokkos view types are writable; callers must not mutate
 * them. Changing a file while a cached instance remains alive does not reload it.
 * @see CyclotronSector
